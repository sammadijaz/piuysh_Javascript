// 02.Variables

// var, let and const

var age = 19;

// Javascript is loosely or statically typed language so we dont have to declare the datatype of a variable before declaring it

// Naming Conventions for variable:

// Cant start with a number or a symbol, Always have to start with a letter

// Cant use dashes(-) in between the name, but can use underscores(_)


// FirstName (this type of naming is used in classes)
// firstName (This one is preffered generally (Cammel case))
